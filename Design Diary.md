# Design Diary – Shay Konradsdottir
## Final Project

### Entry 20200430
Current ideas for the project are to have this be a Discord-like web app, or a visual representation of something. I like using PyGame and Flask, so I may use both to make a rudementary online game. I'm considering using this project as an opportunity to express my interests in my other classes and make visual representations of the current state of things (Coronavirus Pandemic) along with Humboldt State University's response (continuation of classes, tuition costs) and my personal experiences (being sick, psychological health, and turning my home which was just a place I'd sleep into a workplace).

### Entry 20200506
Current idea: A video game using flask as the webserver, QT as a login manager, and pygame for the game itself. The game is a randomly generated pixel map. The pixels can be 'mined' by the players. Then, the players can place these pixels.
Built a system diagram before starting the project. I rarely do this, so this is a big step forward. I limited the gameplay to just mining and am going to shoot for placing the pixels as a stretch goal.
