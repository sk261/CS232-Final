# Design Diary – Shay Konradsdottir
## Final Project

### Entry 20200430
Current ideas for the project are to have this be a Discord-like web app, or a visual representation of something. I like using PyGame and Flask, so I may use both to make a rudementary online game. I'm considering using this project as an opportunity to express my interests in my other classes and make visual representations of the current state of things (Coronavirus Pandemic) along with Humboldt State University's response (continuation of classes, tuition costs) and my personal experiences (being sick, psychological health, and turning my home which was just a place I'd sleep into a workplace).
